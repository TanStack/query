# Example

In this simple example, we integrate React-Query seamlessly with Next.js data fetching methods to fetch queries in the server and hydrate them in the browser.

In addition to fetching and mutating data, React-Query analyzes your queries and their results to construct a client-side cache of your data, which is kept up to date as further queries and mutations are run.

To run this example:

- `npm install` or `yarn`
- `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
