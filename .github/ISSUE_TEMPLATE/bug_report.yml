      description: |
        Please add a link to a minimal reproduction.
        Note:
        - Your bug may get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React/Solid/Vue/Svelte.
        - To create a shareable code example for web, you can use CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) or Stackblitz (https://stackblitz.com/).
        - Please make sure the example is complete and runnable - e.g. avoid localhost URLs.
        - To stub out real api requests - Promise.resolve and Promise.reject are good options for easy reproduction
        - Feel free to fork any of the official CodeSandbox examples to reproduce your issue: https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/examples/react/simple
        - For React Native, you can use: https://snack.expo.dev/
        - For TypeScript related issues only, a TypeScript Playground link might be sufficient: https://www.typescriptlang.org/play
        - Please read these tips for providing a minimal example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.
