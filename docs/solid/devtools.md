Wave your hands in the air and shout hooray because Solid Query comes with dedicated devtools! ðŸ¥³

When you begin your Solid Query journey, you'll want these devtools by your side. They help visualize all of the inner workings of Solid Query and will likely save you hours of debugging if you find yourself in a pinch!

> Also note that you can use these devtools to observe queries, but **not mutations** (yet).

## Install and Import the Devtools

The devtools are a separate package that you need to install:

```bash
$ npm i @tanstack/solid-query-devtools
# or
$ pnpm add @tanstack/solid-query-devtools
# or
$ yarn add @tanstack/solid-query-devtools
```

You can import the devtools like this:

```tsx
import { SolidQueryDevtools } from '@tanstack/solid-query-devtools'
```

By default, Solid Query Devtools are only included in bundles when `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'`, so you don't need to worry about excluding them during a production build.

## Floating Mode

Floating Mode will mount the devtools as a fixed, floating element in your app and provide a toggle in the corner of the screen to show and hide the devtools. This toggle state will be stored and remembered in localStorage across reloads.

Place the following code as high in your Solid app as you can. The closer it is to the root of the page, the better it will work!

```tsx
import { SolidQueryDevtools } from '@tanstack/solid-query-devtools'

function App() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      {/* The rest of your application */}
      <SolidQueryDevtools initialIsOpen={false} />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  )
}
```

### Options

- `initialIsOpen: Boolean`
  - Set this `true` if you want the dev tools to default to being open
- `buttonPosition?: "top-left" | "top-right" | "bottom-left" | "bottom-right"`
  - Defaults to `bottom-left`
  - The position of the Solid Query logo to open and close the devtools panel
- `position?: "top" | "bottom" | "left" | "right"`
  - Defaults to `bottom`
  - The position of the Solid Query devtools panel
- `client?: QueryClient`,
  - Use this to use a custom QueryClient. Otherwise, the one from the nearest context will be used.
- `errorTypes?: { name: string; initializer: (query: Query) => TError}`
  - Use this to predefine some errors that can be triggered on your queries. Initializer will be called (with the specific query) when that error is toggled on from the UI. It must return an Error.
