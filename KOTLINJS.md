# Using Kotlin/JS with React Query

Kotlin/JS declarations for React Query are maintained externally by the Kotlin/JS community and are located at https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers/tree/master/kotlin-react-query.

Because React Query is not written in Kotlin/JS and the declarations are not maintained by the core team, there are no guarantees around the declarations always being up to date or working perfectly. If this is an issue for you, please contribute to the community declarations and discuss solutions there.
