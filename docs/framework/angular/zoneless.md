title: Zoneless Angular
---

Because the Angular adapter for TanStack Query is built on signals, it fully supports Zoneless!

Among Zoneless benefits are improved performance and debugging experience. For details see the [Angular documentation](https://angular.dev/guide/experimental/zoneless).

> Keep in mind that the API for Angular Zoneless is currently experimental and can change in Angular patch versions.
> Besides Zoneless, ZoneJS change detection is also fully supported.
