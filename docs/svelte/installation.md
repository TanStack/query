You can install Svelte Query via [NPM](https://npmjs.com).

> v5 is currently available as a release-candidate. We don't anticipate any major API changes from here on out. We encourage you to try it out and report any issues you find.

### NPM

```bash
$ npm i @tanstack/svelte-query
# or
$ pnpm add @tanstack/svelte-query
# or
$ yarn add @tanstack/svelte-query
```
