Wave your hands in the air and shout hooray because Vue Query comes with dedicated devtools! ðŸ¥³

When you begin your Vue Query journey, you'll want these devtools by your side. They help visualize all of the inner workings of Vue Query and will likely save you hours of debugging if you find yourself in a pinch!

The only thing you need to do is to install official **[Vue Devtools](https://devtools.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html)**

Vue Query will seemingly integrate with official devtools, adding custom inspector and timeline events.
Devtools would be treeshaken from production bundles by default.
