React Query is designed to work out of the box with React Native, with the exception of the devtools, which are only supported with React DOM at this time. 

There is a 3rd party [Flipper](https://fbflipper.com/docs/getting-started/react-native/) plugin which you can try: https://github.com/bgaleotti/react-query-native-devtools

If you would like to help us make the built-in devtools platform agnostic, please let us know!
