```tsx
const result = useSuspenseQueries(options)
```

**Options**

The same as for [useQueries](../reference/useQueries.md), except that each `query` can't have:

- `suspense`
- `throwOnError`
- `enabled`
- `placeholderData`

**Returns**

Same structure as [useQueries](../reference/useQueries.md), except that for each `query`:

- `data` is guaranteed to be defined
- `isPlaceholderData` is missing
- `status` is always `success`
  - the derived flags are set accordingly.

**Caveats**

Keep in mind that the component will only re-mount after **all queries** have finished loading. Hence, if a query has gone stale in the time it took for all the queries to complete, it will be fetched again at re-mount. To avoid this, make sure to set a high enough `staleTime`.

[Cancellation](../guides/query-cancellation.md) does not work.
