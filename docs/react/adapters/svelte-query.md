title: Svelte Query (Coming Soon)
---

> ⚠️ This module has not yet been developed. It requires an adapter similar to `react-query` to work. We estimate the amount of code to do this is low-to-moderate, but does require familiarity with the Svelte framework. If you would like to contribute this adapter, please open a PR!

The `@tanstack/svelte-query` package offers a 1st-class API for using TanStack Query via Svelte. However, all of the primitives you receive from this API are core APIs that are shared across all of the TanStack Adapters including the Query Client, query results, query subscriptions, etc.
