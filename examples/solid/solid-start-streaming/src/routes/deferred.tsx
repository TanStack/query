      <div class="description">
        <p>
          Both queries are configured with deferStream=true, so the server will
          not start streaming HTML to the client until the queries have
          resolved. In this case we are not really taking advantage of streaming
          - this mimics traditional renderAsync + Suspense behavior. Note how
          the green bar in the devtools is much larger now - the client does not
          start receiving any information until 2+ seconds (both queries
          resolve).
        </p>

        <p>
          Clients with javascript disabled will see the resolved state for both
          queries. (try turning off javascript and reloading this page)
        </p>
